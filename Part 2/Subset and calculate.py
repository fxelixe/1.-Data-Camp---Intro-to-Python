Subset and calculate
After you've extracted values from a list,
you can use them to perform additional calculations. 
Take this example, where the second and fourth element of a list x are extracted.
The strings that result are pasted together using the + operator:

x = ["a", "b", "c", "d"]
print(x[1] + x[3])

# Create the areas list
areas = ["hallway", 11.25, "kitchen", 18.0, "living room", 20.0, "bedroom", 10.75, "bathroom", 9.50]

# Sum of kitchen and bedroom area: eat_sleep_area
eat_sleep_area = areas[3] + areas[7]

# Print the variable eat_sleep_area
print(eat_sleep_area)
